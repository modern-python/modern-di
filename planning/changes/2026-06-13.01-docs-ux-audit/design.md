# Design: Docs UX & Consistency Audit

## Summary

A reader-experience audit of all modern-di documentation surfaces — the `docs/`
mkdocs site, `README.md`, the `architecture/` truth-home, and public-API
docstrings. Where the 2026-06-12 audit verified *correctness* (do examples run,
does prose match code), this audit asks **"is this convenient, understandable,
readable, and consistent — and does a brand-new user reach first success
quickly?"** The deliverable is a severity-ranked findings report. No fixes are
applied here; the user reviews the report and selects which findings become an
implementation plan.

## Motivation

The docs were last touched by a correctness-focused audit (57 findings, all
resolved) plus a string of README/site polish commits (#208, #209) and the
mkdocs→GitHub Pages migration. Correctness is in good shape. What has *not* been
audited as a whole is the **learning experience**: whether the onboarding path
is smooth, whether concepts are introduced before they are used, whether
terminology and code idioms are consistent across ~44 pages written
incrementally, and whether the information architecture helps a user find the
answer to a real question. These are exactly the issues a correctness audit does
not surface.

## Non-goals

- Not re-verifying example correctness except as a regression spot-check.
- Not applying fixes — this phase produces a report only.
- Not redesigning the mkdocs theme or visual styling.
- Not auditing the sibling integration repos' own docs (only the integration
  pages that live in this repo's `docs/integrations/`).

## Design

### Audit lens (rubric)

Every in-scope page is read against six lenses, with **new-user onboarding
weighted highest**:

1. **Onboarding (weighted)** — Can a newcomer go from "never heard of this" to a
   working container fast? Is the Quick-Start self-contained? Does the
   introduction sequence build a correct mental model in the right order? Are
   prerequisites stated? Where would a first-timer get stuck or bounce?
2. **Convenience** — Is the happy path obvious and copy-pasteable? Time-to-first
   success? Are common tasks reachable without reverse-engineering?
3. **Understandability** — Concepts introduced before use? Jargon defined? Right
   detail level? Clear mental model, no unexplained leaps?
4. **Readability** — Prose quality, scannability, heading hierarchy, page
   length, code-to-prose ratio.
5. **Findability / IA** — Does the nav group sensibly? Cross-linking between
   related pages? Can a user find the answer to a real question they'd ask?
6. **Consistency** — Terminology, code idioms, tone, naming across pages and
   across surfaces (docs vs. architecture vs. docstrings); internal
   contradictions.
7. **Bugs / inconsistencies** — Stale or wrong content (lighter touch; flag
   regressions vs. the prior audit).

### Scope (≈44 targets)

- **`docs/` mkdocs site** — all pages in `index.md`, `introduction/`,
  `providers/`, `integrations/`, `recipes/`, `testing/`, `troubleshooting/`,
  `migration/`, `dev/`.
- **`README.md`** — the PyPI / GitHub front door.
- **`architecture/`** — the 7 truth-home capability files.
- **Public-API docstrings** — what `help()` and IDE hovers show, across
  `modern_di/`.

### Methodology (workflow phases)

1. **Map** — exact file inventory + mkdocs `nav` order + docstring surface.
2. **Per-page audit (fan-out)** — one agent per page or small cluster, reading as
   a fresh user, returning structured findings (id, severity, category,
   location, issue, suggested fix). Onboarding pages get a dedicated
   "first-time-reader walkthrough" treatment.
3. **Cross-cutting (fan-out)** — agents that require the whole set: the onboarding
   *journey* (index → introduction → first real use), terminology consistency,
   information architecture / nav, cross-surface duplication & drift, and
   README-as-front-door.
4. **Adversarial verify** — each substantive finding checked by an independent
   agent (is it real? is the fix sound?). Refuted findings are dropped.
5. **Synthesize** — dedupe, prioritize, write the report.

### Severity scale

- **High** — blocks or actively misleads a user; a newcomer likely bounces.
- **Medium** — friction or confusion that slows a user down.
- **Low** — polish / nice-to-have.

## Testing

The deliverable is a report, so "landed correctly" means: every finding has a
concrete location (`file` or `file:line`) and a proposed fix; every High/Medium
finding survived adversarial verification; the category×severity table
reconciles with the detailed list.

## Risk

- **Overlap with the prior audit** — mitigated by the explicit lens split
  (experience, not correctness) and treating any correctness hit as a regression
  flag rather than the main product.
- **Subjective findings** — mitigated by the adversarial-verify phase and by
  requiring each finding to name a concrete reader harm, not a style opinion.
- **Token cost** of the multi-agent sweep — accepted; the user opted in.

## Deliverable & follow-up

Report at `planning/audits/2026-06-13-docs-ux-audit-report.md`. The user marks
which findings to fix; the selected set is handed to the planning phase to
produce the implementation plan, after which this bundle moves to `archive/`
with `status: shipped`.
