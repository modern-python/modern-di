# Context data

Often, scopes are connected with external events: HTTP-requests, message from queue, callbacks from framework.

These events can be represented by some objects which can be used for dependencies creation.

There is a special provider which enables access to context data.

You can read more [here](../../providers/context-providers) about ContextProvider and how to work with context data in modern-di in 1.x and higher.
