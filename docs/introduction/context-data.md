# Context data

Often, scopes are connected with external events: HTTP requests, messages from a queue, callbacks from a framework.

These events can be represented by objects which can be used for dependency creation.

There is a special provider that enables access to context data.

You can read more [here](../../providers/context-providers) about ContextProvider and how to work with context data in modern-di 1.x and higher.
